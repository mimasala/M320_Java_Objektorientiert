### Inheritance

Inheritance is a way to reuse code from one class in another. 
It allows a child class to have the attributes and behaviors of a parent class, making it easier to create and maintain an application.

### Abstract classes
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is used as a blueprint for other classes. 
It can have both abstract and non-abstract methods, which provide common behavior and allow subclasses to have their own unique behavior. 
Abstract classes are often used to define common behavior among related classes.

### Interfaces
An interface is a collection of abstract methods that a class must implement. 
It defines behavior that a class must have, but does not provide any implementation. 
This means a class that implements an interface must implement all the methods defined in the interface. 
Interfaces are often used to define common behavior that multiple classes can implement.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. 
In object-oriented programming, polymorphism refers to the ability of a variable, object, or function to take on multiple forms. 
For example, a variable of type Object in Java can hold any type of object, such as a String, a Button, or a Car. 
This allows you to write code that can handle different types of objects in a flexible and generic way.
